# MathCrafter

MathCrafter is a Minecraft-inspired educational game that helps kids practice their math facts while having fun mining for gemstones.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Answer basic math questions (addition and subtraction within 20).
3. For each correct answer, you'll crack the biome.
4. When you've cracked enough of the biome, a gemstone will appear. Click on it to collect it.
5. Use your gemstones to buy new pickaxes and unlock new biomes in the shop.
6. Be careful! Wrong answers will damage your pickaxe. If all your pickaxes break, the game is over.
